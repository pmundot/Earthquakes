    "## Motivations\n",
    "Last year on February 15th,2019 at 05:09am (MST) a 3.7M earthquake hit Bluffdale, UT. The magnitude was enough for residents in neighboring cities such as Draper and Riverton, to feel the ground shake. This caused many people in the area to wonder about their safety as well as their preparedness for if another earthquake were to occur. As residents of a city built on a faultline, we are keenly aware of the ubiquity of earthquakes to life in Salt Lake City.  \n",
    "Earthquakes happen all over the world, most of which we cannot feel. As citizens living along a major faultline, the question of earthquake magnitude and danger is always a concern. This project will look at the historical data of earthquakes around the globe and determine the danger of displacement, property damage, injury, and death (called impact factors from this point forward)."

    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "For this project, we are trying to answer the following questions for a specific set of locations:\n",
    "What are the magnitudes of the earthquakes within a 50-mile radius of the location?\n",
    "How often do earthquakes at each location occur?\n",
    "What is the probability of earthquakes at each magnitude for each location?\n",
    "What is the probability of displacement, property damage, injury, or death in an earthquake?\n",
    "What other information, like GDP of the country, population density, etc, affects impact factors for a location? \n",
    "We will be investigating these claims by analyzing seismographic information about earthquakes, information about effects of earthquakes, and looking at a variety of other data types (national GDP, population, population density, etc) . \n",
    " Next, we hope to apply the information gleaned from the data to a geomap for a visualization as well as creating a boundary for the number of earthquakes in an area. \n"
